  <p>The person leading the U.S. response to the <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/your-most-pressing-questions-about-the-coronavirus-answered-c99bff5f02e9" target="_blank">coronavirus outbreak</a> , Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her family for a <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/practical-tips-to-prepare-for-the-coronavirus-42a0f3b43ba0" target="_blank">possible pandemic</a>that could cause “severe” disruption to everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close, and social gatherings are discouraged.</p>

  <p>“I had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning,” Messonnier said today in a conference call with reporters. “And I told my children that while I didn’t think that they were at risk right now, we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption to our lives.”</p>

  <p>Messonnier, who directs the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, sounded the most concerning tone yet that <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-in-us.html#datatracker-home" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> , as the disease is called, will likely become a pandemic. “The fact that this virus has caused illness and death, along with sustained person-to-person spread is concerning,” she said. It meets two of the criteria for a pandemic. Meanwhile, she said, “the world moves closer to meeting the third criteria: worldwide spread of the new virus.”</p>

  <blockquote class="gray">“We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that their lives will be disrupted because of this pandemic.”</blockquote>

  <p>That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that appear without a known source of exposure — are now occurring in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.</p>

  <p>“Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,” Messonnier said. It’s no longer a question of if, she says, but when and how many people will become severely ill.</p>
